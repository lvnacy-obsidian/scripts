# Changelog - Development Improvements & ESLint Integration

**Date:** September 28, 2025  
**Branch:** main  
**Type:** Enhancement & Code Quality

## üéØ Summary

This release introduces comprehensive ESLint integration, code quality improvements, and enhanced development tooling to the JavaScript automation submodule. The changes focus on standardizing code style, improving developer experience, and expanding the library with TypeScript examples.

## üîß Development Infrastructure

### ESLint Integration
- **Added ESLint configuration** with modern flat config format (`eslint.config.js`)
- **Comprehensive rule set** including:
  - Code quality rules (no-eval, no-shadow, prefer-const)
  - Style enforcement via @stylistic/eslint-plugin
  - Best practices (curly braces, default-case-last)
  - Modern JavaScript preferences (no-var, prefer-template)
- **New npm script**: `npm run lint` for code linting
- **Dependencies added**:
  - `eslint@^9.36.0`
  - `@eslint/js@^9.36.0`
  - `@stylistic/eslint-plugin@^5.4.0`

### Build System Improvements
- **Major restructuring** in `build-snippets.js`:
  - Updated library path to unified `library/` structure
  - Removed commented-out legacy code
  - Streamlined metadata extraction logic
  - Improved placeholder processing efficiency
  - Enhanced error handling and logging
  - Fixed import paths for consolidated utilities
  - Added parallel file processing for better performance

## üìö Library Enhancements & Restructuring

### Major Library Consolidation
- **Unified library structure**: Consolidated `library-scripts/` and `library-snippets/` into single `library/` directory
- **Improved organization**:
  - `library/scripts/` - Core template and service components (formerly `library-scripts/`)
  - `library/snippets-vscode/` - VS Code snippet source files (formerly `library-snippets/`)
  - `library/utilities/` - Shared utilities and loggers (formerly root `utilities/`)
- **Cleaner build configuration**: Updated `build-snippets.js` to use unified library path
- **Enhanced directory structure** with better separation of concerns

### New TypeScript Examples
- **Created comprehensive TypeScript examples** in `library/snippets-vscode/examples.ts`
- **Snippet collection** including:
  - TypeScript invocable functions for CodeScript
  - Advanced button configurations
  - Plugin boilerplate templates
  - Obsidian API integration examples
- **Enhanced metadata** with proper snippet prefixes and descriptions

### Modal System Improvements
- **Enhanced BaseModal** (`library-scripts/service/baseModal.js`):
  - Improved logging integration with structured context
  - Better error handling for CSS loading
  - Consistent code formatting with ESLint standards
  - Enhanced debugging capabilities

- **LaunchModal service** (`library-scripts/service/launchModal.js`):
  - Code style improvements for consistency
  - Better variable naming and structure
  - Enhanced error handling patterns

### Template System Updates
- **Template files** (`library-scripts/templates/`):
  - `example.js`: Improved code structure and formatting
  - `template.js`: Enhanced template generation logic
  - Better integration with modal system
  - Consistent coding patterns

## üóÇÔ∏è File Cleanup & Organization

### Removed Legacy Files
- **Eliminated outdated structure**:
  - Removed old `library-scripts/` and `library-snippets/` directories
  - Cleaned up orphaned `.gitkeep` files
  - Removed duplicate documentation files
  - Eliminated deprecated styling files (`styles/` directory)
  - Removed legacy reference files (`reference/modalEl.json`)
- **Consolidated documentation**: Moved VS Code snippet README to `docs/snippets-reference/`
- **Streamlined todo management**: Consolidated todo items into root `todo.md`

### Directory Structure Optimization
- **Logical grouping**: Related files now grouped under appropriate subdirectories
- **Reduced directory depth**: Eliminated unnecessary nesting
- **Consistent naming**: Standardized naming conventions across file structure
- **Path optimization**: Updated all import/export paths for new structure

## üßπ Code Quality Improvements

### Formatting & Style
- **Consistent indentation**: Tab-based indentation across all files
- **Quote standardization**: Single quotes with template literal support
- **Object formatting**: Consistent spacing in object literals
- **Semicolon enforcement**: Consistent semicolon usage

### Error Handling
- **Enhanced logging**: Structured logging contexts throughout the codebase
- **Better error messages**: More descriptive error handling in modal system
- **Defensive programming**: Improved null checks and validation

### Modern JavaScript
- **ES Module consistency**: Proper import/export statements
- **Const/let usage**: Eliminated var declarations
- **Template literals**: Preferred over string concatenation
- **Destructuring**: Enhanced object and array destructuring patterns
