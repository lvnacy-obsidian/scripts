# 2025-10-01 Testing Framework Review and Commit Session

## Session Overview
This session involved a comprehensive review of recent changes to the Obsidian Scripts submodule, followed by the creation of a detailed changelog and commit of all pending changes. The focus was on documenting the establishment of a complete testing framework and application of ESLint linting improvements.

## Changes Reviewed and Committed

### üß™ Testing Framework Implementation
- **Complete test infrastructure**: New `/tests/` directory with organized validation system
- **Main validation script**: `validate-main.js` providing comprehensive orchestration
- **Modular validators**: Separate validation for snippets, scripts, syntax, metadata, and more
- **Service classes**: Dedicated validation service classes for different validation types
- **Integration testing**: Support for VS Code snippet functionality and watch mode testing

### üîß Development Container Setup
- **DevContainer configuration**: Docker-based development environment with automated setup
- **VS Code integration**: ESLint and TypeScript extensions with consistent development experience
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and troubleshooting guides

### üéØ Linting Patch and Build Enhancements  
- **ESLint consistency**: Applied comprehensive linting fixes to `build-snippets.js`
- **Package.json expansion**: Added 19+ new npm scripts for development workflow
- **Quality assurance**: Lint, test, validate scripts with various modes (strict, verbose, CI)
- **Development maintenance**: Doctor, format, quality, report, precommit, clean scripts

### üìÅ File Organization
- **VS Code workspace**: Updated workspace configuration
- **Development tooling**: New launch.json, tasks.json for debugging and automation
- **Configuration updates**: Enhanced snippet-config.json with new categories
- **Documentation**: Expanded reference materials and troubleshooting guides
